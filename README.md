Enable a player to fly in survival mode! A player’s fly will be disabled if they start starving , void damage or someone hits them! In the config you can edit the messages for when someone enables or disables the fly. You’re not allowed to toggle the fly command while in creative mode, there’s a message you can configure for it.

If you want to disable a player’s fly while they’re switching between levels then enable it in the config, there’s also a message if you do enable the option.

This plugin is the best flying plugin for pmmp. Why ? Because there's no bugs and it's straight to the point.
